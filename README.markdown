# ITProTV's Haskell style guide

> [Haskell 2010](https://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/haskell2010/) ought to be enough for anybody.

This guide describes how we like to write [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) at [ITProTV](https://www.itpro.tv).
It focuses more on style and best practices than formatting and layout.

These are _recommendations_, not hard and fast rules.
Deviating from the guide is encouraged as long as you can defend your decision in code review.

In general we prefer clarity over cleverness.
Try to write code that is easy to understand, debug, and modify.

This guide is a living document.
If you want to add, change, or remove a suggestion,
please [open an issue](https://github.com/EdutainmentLIVE/haskell-style-guide/issues/new)!

## Avoid compiler warnings

Code should compile with `-Weverything` and `-Werror`.
We ignore a few warnings:

- `-Wno-implicit-prelude`
- `-Wno-safe`
- `-Wno-unsafe`

<https://medium.com/mercury-bank/enable-all-the-warnings-a0517bc081c3>

## Avoid language extensions

GHC provides a large number of language extensions.
Enabling them creates a staggering number of custom sub-languages.
Sticking to the defaults makes things easier to learn.

``` hs
-- bad
{-# LANGUAGE LambdaCase #-}
\ case
  () -> ()

-- good
\ x -> case x of
  () -> ()
```

<https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2018/02/10/an-opinionated-guide-to-haskell-in-2018/#any-flavor-you-like>

## Apply HLint suggestions

We use [HLint](https://github.com/ndmitchell/hlint#readme) to lint all Haskell code.
It suggests many good ways to improve code.
We use a somewhat custom configuration, but the exact details aren't too important.

<https://neilmitchell.blogspot.com/2009/09/how-i-use-hlint.html>

## Format with Brittany

We use [Brittany](https://github.com/lspitzner/brittany#readme) to format all Haskell code.
It may not format everything perfectly, but we prefer it to arguing about layout.

<https://chrisdone.com/posts/hindent-5>

## Prefer `let` over `where`

`let` is an expression and follows the same rules as everything else.
`where` can only be used with declarations and can be awkward to use with `do` notation, guards, and point-free code.

``` hs
-- bad
3 * kibi where kibi = 2 ^ 10

-- good
let kibi = 2 ^ 10 in 3 * kibi
```

<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4362328/haskell-where-vs-let>

## Avoid out of order binders

Even though the values bound in a `let` expression can be given in any order,
they should be defined in a way that makes them easy to read from top to bottom.

``` hs
-- bad
let
  x = y
  y = 1
in x

-- good
let
  y = 1
  x = y
in x
```

## Prefer `case` expressions

`case` expressions are generally easier to grok even though they're often longer than the equivalent expression using functions.

``` hs
-- bad
putStrLn ("howdy " ++ maybe "stranger." (++ "!") maybeName)

-- good
putStrLn (case maybeName of
  Nothing -> "stranger."
  Just name -> name ++ "!")
```

<https://www.yesodweb.com/blog/2015/10/beginner-friendly-code-and-apis>

## Avoid unnecessary eta reduction

Excessively point-free code can be difficult to puzzle out.
In general prefer explicit lambdas and function application.

``` hs
-- bad
((. f) . compare .)

-- good
\ x y -> compare (f x) (f y)
```

However sometimes eta expansion can make things harder to read.
Keep things point-free if it's easier to see the shape of an expression.

``` hs
-- bad
sum xs = foldr (\ x y -> x + y) 0 xs

-- good
sum = foldr (+) 0
```

<https://wiki.haskell.org/Pointfree>

## Avoid multiple function declarations

Multiple function declarations force you to repeat the function name and all the arguments.
Renaming any one of them requires changing every line.
Also each function declaration could use different argument names, which would be confusing.

``` hs
-- bad
factorial 0 = 1
factorial n = n * factorial (n - 1)

-- good
factorial n = case n of
  0 -> 1
  _ -> n * factorial (n - 1)
```

## Prefer `do` notation

`do` notation is generally easier to read because it's similar to imperative code.
It's also easier to modify, for example by adding logging.
Compact expressions using explicit monadic operators like `(>>=)` should be avoided.

``` hs
-- bad
getLine >>= print

-- good
do line <- getLine
   print line
```

## Avoid pure `do`

Normally `do` notation is used for monadic expressions.
It is possible to use it with pure expressions, but it's confusing.

``` hs
-- bad
double x = do
  let two = 2
  x * two

-- good
double x =
  let two = 2
  in x * two
```

## Avoid writing partial functions

Partial functions are difficult to work with because they can fail but their type signatures don't express that.
Avoid non-exhaustive pattern matching, `undefined`, and `error`.
Instead prefer types like `Maybe result` or `Either failure success`.

``` hs
-- bad
first (x : _) = x

-- good
first xs = case xs of
  x : _ -> Just x
  _ -> Nothing
```

<https://www.parsonsmatt.org/2017/10/11/type_safety_back_and_forth.html>

## Avoid using partial functions

Many libraries, including the standard library, come with partial functions that throw exceptions at runtime.
Wherever possible, avoid using these partial functions and prefer their total (non-partial) versions instead.

``` hs
-- bad
head []

-- good
listToMaybe []
```

<https://begriffs.com/posts/2013-08-18-dont-be-partial-to-partial-functions.html>

## Group all imports together

Imports should not be split into two groups: third-party and first-party.
"Third-party" means anything that comes from Stackage (or Hackage, or GitHub).
"First-party" means anything that comes from the project itself (or other private dependencies).
Splitting imports into groups makes it easier to figure out where to look for documentation.

``` hs
-- bad
import qualified Data.Aeson as Aeson

import qualified ITProTV.Internal.Secrets as Secrets

-- good
import qualified Data.Aeson as Aeson
import qualified ITProTV.Internal.Secrets as Secrets
```

## Avoid importing parents

A module like `A.B.C` shouldn't import anything from `A.B` or `A`.
However it is fine to import from `A.B.C.D` or `A.E`.
This makes the module hierarchy easier to understand.

## Prefer qualified imports

Qualifying imports makes it clear where things come from at the cost of making things more verbose.

``` hs
-- bad
import Data.Aeson
import Data.Text (Text, pack, unpack)

-- good
import qualified Data.Aeson as Aeson
import qualified Data.Text as Text
```

When importing a module named `A.B.â€¦.Z`, generally prefer aliasing it as `Z`.

<https://www.parsonsmatt.org/2017/06/23/on_naming_things.html>

## Prefer unqualified operators

Qualified operators are visually noisy and can be hard to read.
Import them explicitly instead of using them from a qualified import.

``` hs
-- bad
import qualified Data.Aeson as Aeson
Aeson.object [ "successful" Aeson..= True ]

-- good
import Data.Aeson ((.=))
import qualified Data.Aeson
Aeson.object [ "successful" .= True ]
```

## Prefer functions over operators

When both a function and an operator are available,
prefer the function over the operator.
Functions always follow the same rules,
unlike operators which force you to take precedence into consideration.

``` hs
-- bad
scooby & snack .~ True

-- good
set snack True scooby
```

## Prefer short identifiers

Exported identifiers only need to be unique in the module that they're defined in.
Modules should be used to separate namespaces.

``` hs
-- bad
data Company = Company { companyName :: Text }
data User = User { userName :: Text }

-- good
module Company where
  data Company = Company { name :: Text }
module User where
  data User = User { name :: Text }
```

## Use camel case names

There's no good rationale for this, it's just convention.
Avoid using underscores to separate words in identifiers.
Instead use upper case letters for new words.

``` hs
-- bad
type LOUD_SNAKE = ()
quiet_snake = ()

-- good
type LoudSnake = ()
quietSnake = ()
```

In spite of this, some names like `IO` are written in all caps.

## Avoid primes in names

``` hs
-- bad
users' = filter isAdmin users

-- good
admins = filter isAdmin users

-- okay
users_ = filter isAdmin users
users2 = filter isAdmin users
```

Primes in names are confusing and should be avoided.
Try to use descriptive names instead.
If there isn't a better name to use,
adding an underscore or number as a suffix is acceptable.

<http://elm-lang.org/blog/the-perfect-bug-report#less-syntax>

## Avoid multiple underscore suffixes

Using a single underscore is a fine way to distinguish values that would otherwise have the same name.
However if you find yourself having more than one underscore, consider using a different suffix like a number instead.

``` hs
-- bad
users = ...
users_ = ...
users__ = ...

-- good
users1 = ...
users2 = ...
users3 = ...
```

## Avoid explicit export lists

Explicitly listing exports often causes a lot of busywork.

``` hs
-- bad
module Toppings ( pepperoni ) where

-- good
module Toppings where
```

## Avoid `String`

`String` is a linked list of characters,
which is a remarkably bad data type for almost all purposes.
Whenever possible, prefer using `Text` instead.

``` hs
-- bad
"beans" :: String

-- good
"beans" :: Text
```

<http://www.stephendiehl.com/posts/strings.html>

## Use `newtype` liberally

Type aliases (with `type`) don't add any type safety.
Type wrappers (with `newtype`) add type safety and don't have any runtime cost.

``` hs
-- bad
type Name = Text

-- good
newtype Name = Name Text
```

<https://robots.thoughtbot.com/lessons-learned-avoiding-primitives-in-elm>

## Use smart constructors

Rather than trying to make everything correct by construction,
prefer simple `newtype` wrappers with smart constructors to check invariants.

``` hs
-- bad
data Email = Email
  { localPart :: Text
  , domain :: Text
  }

-- good
module Email ( Email, textToEmail, emailToText ) where

newtype Email = Email Text

textToEmail :: Text -> Maybe Email
textToEmail x = if isEmail x
  then Just (Email x)
  else Nothing

emailToText :: Email -> Text
emailToText (Email x) = x
```

<https://haskell-at-work.com/episodes/2018-02-26-validation-with-smart-constructors.html>

## Expose record constructors and fields

For records, hiding constructors and fields introduces too much boilerplate.
Unlike `newtype`s, you should simply export the constructors and fields.

``` hs
-- bad
module Example ( Person, makePerson, getPersonName, setPersonName ) where
data Person = Person { personName :: String }
makePerson = Person
getPersonName = personName
setPersonName person name = person { personName = name }

-- good
module Example ( Person(..) ) where
data Person = Person { personName :: String }
```

<https://www.yesodweb.com/book/settings-types>

## Use descriptive unwrapping names

If the function that removes a `newtype` wrapper starts with `unwrap`,
that implies the result is essentially the internal representation of that type.
That may be true now, but it might change as time goes on.
Also using a more descriptive function names makes call sites easier to understand.
So instead of `unwrapX` use `xToY`.

``` hs
-- bad
unwrapEmail :: Email -> Text

-- good
emailToText :: Email -> Text
```

## Avoid list comprehensions

List comprehensions are cute,
but they're not often used and can be difficult to puzzle out.
Prefer using regular functions or `do` notation instead.

``` hs
-- bad
[ x * 2 | x <- xs, x > 0 ]

-- good
map (* 2) (filter (> 0) xs)

-- okay
do
  x <- xs
  guard (x > 0)
  pure (x * 2)
```

## Prefer monads for building records

When building a record it is tempting to use the applicative operators `(<$>)` and `(<*>)`.
However they can pose a problem when the expression is polymorphic because it's hard to tell if the right values are being put into the right slots.
Even though the monadic way of writing things is more verbose, it's a lot harder to mess up.

``` hs
-- bad
instance FromJSON Episode where
  parseJSON = withObject "Episode" $ \ object -> Episode
    <$> object .: "title"
    <*> object .: "subtitle"

-- good
instance FromJSON Episode where
  parseJSON = withObject "Episode" $ \ object -> do
    title <- object .: "title"
    subtitle <- object .: "subtitle"
    pure Episode
      { episodeTitle = title
      , episodeSubtitle = subtitle
      }
```

## Avoid multi-layered nesting

When seeking values from a nested object, avoid creating nested case statements. Instead seek to pull one value out at a time.

``` hs
-- bad
case foo of
  Just bar -> case Bar.maybeField bar of
    Just baz -> Baz.maybeField baz
    Nothing -> Nothing
  Nothing -> Nothing
-- good
maybeFieldBar <- case foo of
  Just bar -> Bar.maybeField bar
  Nothing -> Nothing
case maybeFieldBar of
  Just baz -> Baz.maybeField baz
  Nothing -> Nothing
```

## Derive at least `Eq` and `Show`

Both the `Eq` and `Show` type classes are frequently used for debugging. Be sure to derive them for any custom types that you define.

``` hs
-- bad
data Switch
  = Off
  | On

-- good
data Switch
  = Off
  | On
  deriving (Eq, Show)
```

The only exception is for types that have sensitive information in them, like passwords. In that case you may want no `Show` instance at all, or you may want an instance that hides the information.

``` hs
newtype Password
  = Password Text
  deriving Eq

instance Show Password where
  show = const "Password \"REDACTED\""
```
